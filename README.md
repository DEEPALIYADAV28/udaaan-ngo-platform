# Udaaan NGO Management Platform

A role-based web platform designed to digitally manage the operations of **Udaaan Aasma Tak**, an NGO focused on educating underprivileged students in nearby villages.

---

## Problem Statement

Udaaan Aasma Tak is an NGO founded in 2012 that works continuously with a nearby village to educate underprivileged students.  
Every academic year, volunteers, council members, and mentors change, while some members leave mid-year and others continue or return later.

Currently, most operations are handled manually, which creates several challenges:

- No centralized system for managing volunteers, council members, and alumni
- Difficulty tracking role changes across academic years
- Manual handling of class timetables and attendance
- Limited visibility for alumni and external supporters
- No structured platform for volunteer onboarding and exit tracking

---

## Solution

This project aims to build a **centralized, role-based platform** that serves both external viewers and internal members of the NGO.

The platform will:
- Allow outsiders to learn about Udaan’s mission and support the NGO
- Provide volunteers with class schedules and responsibilities
- Enable council members to manage academic operations and events
- Keep alumni connected with ongoing activities

A key design focus of the system is an **academic year–based role lifecycle**, ensuring accurate tracking of members even when they join, leave, or change roles.
